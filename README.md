# UFPI Interface for Controlling KUKA LBR iiwa Robot
This project aims to construct a platform interface using the Java language on the smartPAD via the Sunrise Workbench software. The purpose is to enable real-time control of KUKA iiwa robots, through the hand guiding feature, with the intention of simplifying the programming process and making it accessible to individuals without prior programming knowledge.
The hand guiding motion feature is also used to achieve more accurate positioning within narrow spaces and crowded environments Safety requirements, such as Automatic stop on collisions, impedance control, and Tool Centre Point (TCP) calibration methods, will be taken into consideration. Additionally, this research endeavours to provide a roadmap for future advancements in the integration of collaborative robots into assembly processes, fostering further improvements in this field.










You must add the DirectServo and the SmartServo libraries into the Sunrise.Workbench environment.
